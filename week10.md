From the previous meeting, we had already decided on the parameters that we wished to include in our model, which were start inside temperature, end inside temperature, CO2 level of the room, and the starting outside temperature. We made use of 3 machine learning algorithms to do our modelling, which were random forest, linear model, and svm. R provides libraries which made it easy for us to use these functions.
