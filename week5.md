As we narrowed the time periods that we modelled, clearer patterns in the data emerged. We began to notice that there are distinct periods in the day in which the AC functions. While the Ac itself would work to cool or heat the room at the same rate each time, there are of course other factors that are involved that might change the rate at which the room is heated or cooled. These ‘heating’ and ‘cooling’ regions appear to be important in allowing us to work out the rate at which the room heats or cools. Knowing how quickly a room heats or cools would then allow us to work out how long it would take a room to reach a particular temperature, given a certain start temperature and a set point temperature (the temperature it needs to reach) Thus, the next intermediate goal of our project is to be able to identify these heating and cooling periods. 

As we modelled the data in terms of months, it was clear that while winter had very distinct heating and cooling periods, summer was very unpredictable. With Melbourne weather how it is, it was not uncommon for the temperature to be 40 degrees one day, and 20 degrees the next. This unpredictability might make it difficult for us to come up with a function that can clearly identify a heating or cooling period. Consequently, we decided it would be better to focus on the winter periods for now, as they seem to have distinct heating periods – usually in the early mornings sometime between 6.30am – 9am.

There doesn’t appear to be any pre-existing library or algorithm that we can use, so we will probably have to create this function ourselves. The general idea of how this algorithm is intended to work, is for it to find the specific time periods in which the room appears to be heating (where the temperature is rising), and using the start and end points of this time period, fit a linear model to it to try and find the rate of heating. 

There were some issues that we encountered when trying to plot this data, that is, there are a number of variables in the data that we are not sure of. There is a variable ‘AC_Status’, that is mostly off and rarely on. At first, we assumed it meant whether or not the AC was on, however, even when the AC is off it seems that the room is still being heated or cooled.
