We managed to accomplish our goal last week, and we now have a heat detection function that is able to identify the periods in which the room is being heated, and find the rate at which the room is being heated. We also have a function that is able to produce a dataframe of these results.

There were a number of things that needed to be considered when trying to identify these heating periods. For example, how many values need to be the same before we decide to ‘cut’ that into a distinct heating period. It seems that this function is capable of identifying these periods of time fairly well, and we can progress to the next phase of our project. 

We now need to consider what variables we should model the rate of change against. There has been research done into this particular topic, and there are many similarities between this project and other previous projects. However, different papers appear to take into account different variables, depending on the location and what they were trying to achieve. For example, in one particular paper, the researchers took into account the level of humidity of that region. As this is not a variable that has been given to us, nor is it a variable of particular interest, we need to think a little bit more about the factors that might be important in our particular case.
