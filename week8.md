We got a chance to meet with building management this week, and were able to clarify several points of confusion that we had encountered in our data. It was certainly a very insightful meeting.

We had previously made the assumption that the AC was the main source of heating and cooling of the room. Even though a few weeks ago, when the AC_status variable appeared to be mostly off, we simply assumed that perhaps there was either something wrong with the data, or that AC_Status meant something else. It turns out, AC status does reflect the status of the AC and whether or not it was on and off. This didn’t make sense to us at first, until we found out that it is the OAPU that is responsible for the main heating and cooling of the room, and not the AC! The OAPU (Outdoor Air Processing Unit) is the central heating and cooling system and it is managed by the building managers. Most rooms also have an AC that can then be manually switched on and off by occupants of the room to supplement this heating and cooling. 

They also provided us with some insight as to how heating and cooling generally works at Monash. For example, the systems are turned on from 6.45am – 7pm every working day, and remain off during other periods of time. Different rooms also had some very different properties, e.g. some rooms could actually be opened up and joined with other rooms, and some rooms had an open floor plan. These pieces of information may be important at later stages when trying to come up with conclusions regarding our data.

It was great that the building managers helped us clarify our doubts, but it also meant that we needed to change the things we were looking at. Hence, our plan for this week is to apply our heating detection algorithm to the OAPU files, rather than the AC files as we had done previously, and try and see if there are any conclusions we can make from this.
