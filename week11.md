After doing the modelling, we also did cross validation on our models. The data was partitioned into 7 segments. We trained on 6, and would test on the last set, and repeated this process 7 times, and then compared our predicted results and actual results. We took the root mean square error of the predicted results and actual results as a measure of how accurate our model was. 
From our results, it seems that all 3 algorithms produce results that are about the same level of accuracy. 
At this point, we are beginning to wrap up our project. We have essentially accomplished what we set out to do, which was to predict the rate of heating and cooling of a room.
