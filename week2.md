Week 2
Had our first meeting with our supervisors, Arnaud & Cristoph this week. We were introduced to the project and given the data set that we will be using for this project. 
The data set given was taken from one of the buildings at Monash, and the temperatures were recorded at 15 minute intervals over the course of a year. An initial glance of the data set shows that the various parameters taken into account for each data set is not consistent. However, as Arnaud mentioned, for parameters such as the outdoor roof temperature, this can be easily appended on to the other data sets. In general, at least the date/time and set temperature of all the AC units is known. 
As stated in the project description, the aim of this project is to be able to simulate how the AC units perform as a function of different parameters. We would like to plot the room temperature as a function of time, and from this, try and determine given a particular outside temperature, if we can figure out what the inside temperature is going to be. Doing so would allow building managers better control over automation of AC units, and this could also potentially be helpful for energy efficiency purposes.  
To-do before next meeting
