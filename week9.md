Thankfully, as there wasnâ€™t a huge difference between the OAPU and AC files, we were easily able to apply the same functions on the different files without wasting a  huge amount of time. As we are now able to detect these heating and cooling periods, and can find the rate at which the room is being heated, the main topic of discussion for our meeting was about starting the actual modelling. 

One thing we need to keep in mind when producing our model, is the parameters which we wish to include in our model. This was brought up a few meetings back, and over the past few weeks, we have played around with a few different combinations. There were of course, many variables that may need to be taken into account, but we were not sure which were the most important. Hence we conducted a few ANOVA tests and drafted a few linear regression models to try and come up with clearer visuals of what the data contained. We looked at the response of the internal temperature vs external temperature, and decided to plot the rate at which the room was heated, against variables such as external starting temperature, external end temperature. Our supervisor pointed out it may also be worthwhile to consider the CO2 levels as well. At this point, we had only considered plotting variables on a one to one basis (e.g. temp vs another variable), but in the meeting, we also discussed how we may want to have a multi-variable model, as it is not only one variable that impacts the temperature.
