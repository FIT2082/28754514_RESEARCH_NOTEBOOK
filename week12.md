The main bulk of our research had been completed, and most of our work this week was focused on drafting our poster and report. 

It has certainly been an interesting experience, and I feel like I have learned a lot more about data science and machine learning. I've also been exposed to a new programming environment, and some very useful libraries that Iâ€™m sure I can apply to other areas in the future. 
While I had not taken any electives or had much knowledge about these topics prior to this project, I have definitely gained some useful skills from this project and have learned a lot.
